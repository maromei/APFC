    abstract = {Comprehensive investigations of crystalline systems often require methods bridging atomistic and continuum scales. In this context, coarse-grained mesoscale approaches are of particular interest as they allow the examination of large systems and time scales while retaining some microscopic details. The so-called phase-field crystal (PFC) model conveniently describes crystals at diffusive time scales through a continuous periodic field which varies on atomic scales and is related to the atomic number density. To go beyond the restrictive atomic length scales of the PFC model, a complex amplitude formulation was first developed by Goldenfeld et al (2005 Phys. Rev. E 72 020601). While focusing on length scales larger than the lattice parameter, this approach can describe crystalline defects, interfaces, and lattice deformations. It has been used to examine many phenomena including liquid/solid fronts, grain boundary energies, and strained films. This topical review focuses on this amplitude expansion of the PFC model and its developments. An overview of the derivation, connection to the continuum limit, representative applications, and extensions is presented. A few practical aspects, such as suitable numerical methods and examples, are illustrated as well. Finally, the capabilities and bounds of the model, current challenges, and future perspectives are addressed.}

    abstract = {In many processes for crystalline materials such as precipitation, heteroepitaxy, alloying, and phase transformation, lattice expansion or compression of embedded domains occurs. This can significantly alter the mechanical response of the material. Typically, these phenomena are studied macroscopically, thus neglecting the underlying microscopic structure. Here we present the prototypical case of an elastic inclusion described by a mesoscale model, namely a coarse-grained phase-field crystal model. A spatially-dependent parameter is introduced into the free energy functional to control the local spacing of the lattice structure, effectively prescribing an eigenstrain. The stress field obtained for an elastic inclusion in a 2D triangular lattice is shown to match well with the analytic solution of the Eshelby inclusion problem.}
