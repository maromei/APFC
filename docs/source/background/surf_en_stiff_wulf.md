# Surface Energy and Stiffness

## Surface Energy

Based on {cite:t}`2018Ofori_anisotrop_pfc` 1D surface energy
$\gamma(\theta)$ can be computed from real amplitudes $\phi_m$
in the following way:

Assuming 1D real amplitudes:

$$
\begin{equation}
\gamma = \sum\limits_m^3 \left[
    \eta_m^{\prime} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \eta_m^{\prime\prime}}
    - \eta_m^{\prime} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \eta_m^{\prime}}
    + 2 \eta_m^{\prime\prime} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \eta_m^{\prime\prime}}
\right]
\end{equation}
$$

This will get projected onto a circle with the normal vector
$\boldsymbol{n} = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$. It is also used that the
curvature $\kappa_j$ can be defined as $\partial^2$
